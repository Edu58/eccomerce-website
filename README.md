### Live Link - https://laptops-sale.netlify.app/

### Summary
An eCommerce website for selling laptops. Made with html, css and javascript.
The first page includes a carousel. The live link doesn't show the carousel as netlify doesn't support node modules.
However, if you clone the repo and run the index.html in your browser you will get the full experience.
